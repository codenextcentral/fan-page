    <h2>Rick and Morty</h2>
    <img src="images/rick-morty.jpg">
    <p>A TV show I'm a fan of right now is <strong>Rick and Morty</strong>. It's mad dope, all 3
       seasons. <br> A shy kid named <em>Morty</em> goes on adventures across dimensions with his
       ingenious grandfather, <em>Rick Sanchez</em>. <br> The most recent season just ended,
       but new episodes usually come on Adult Swim Sunday nights.
